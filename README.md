## üéì Task for Students & Learners

Your challenge is to clone this project and extend its functionality. This is a great way to practice your skills.

### Your Mission:

1.  **Clone & Run:**
    * Clone this repository to your local machine.
    * Follow the setup steps below to get both the frontend and backend running.

2.  **Add an "Edit" Feature:**
    * **Backend:** Create a new `PUT /api/todos/{todo_id}` endpoint in `backend/main.py` that allows changing the text of an existing task.
    * **Frontend:** Add an "Edit" button next to each task. When clicked, it should allow the user to modify the task's text and save the changes by calling your new backend endpoint.

3.  **Add a "Clear All Completed" Button:**
    * **Backend:** Implement a `DELETE /api/todos/completed` endpoint that removes all tasks marked as complete.
    * **Frontend:** Add a button that calls this new endpoint to clear multiple tasks at once.

4.  **Improve Styling:**
    * Get creative! Change the colors, fonts, and layout. Add animations or transitions to make the user experience smoother.
